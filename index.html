        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>As a working Graphic Designer I find that our industry is constantly shifting towards becoming more and more involved witht the web. I have always had a passion for working with layouts and making things as user friendly as possible leading me to pursue Front End Development.</p>
        <p> I love to build things but most importantly I love to build on the knowledge that I already have to continue growing both personally and as a professional.</p>
